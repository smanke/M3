# Builds, Developer-ID-signs, notarizes, and staples "M3 Tracker.app" for
# distribution outside the Mac App Store, then zips it for upload/download.
#
# One-time setup before running this:
#   1. In Xcode: Settings -> Accounts -> your team -> Manage Certificates ->
#      "+" -> Developer ID Application. This installs a signing identity.
#   2. Store notarization credentials once:
#        xcrun notarytool store-credentials "M3TrackerNotary" \
#          --apple-id "you@example.com" \
#          --team-id "YOURTEAMID" \
#          --password "an-app-specific-password"
#      (generate the app-specific password at appleid.apple.com; team ID is
#      shown next to your Developer ID Application identity, or in
#      developer.apple.com/account -> Membership details)
#
# Then run:
#   ./release.sh "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)"
set -euo pipefail
